## 2025-08-09: Adoption of a Formal UI Style Guide

### Context
The application's UI was developed without a formal, centralized design system. This led to inconsistencies in styling and made it difficult for developers (especially AI agents) to create new UI components that matched the existing design. There was no single source of truth for colors, fonts, spacing, or widget styles.

### Decision
A formal UI style guide based on Google's Material Design was implemented to address this issue. The implementation consists of the following new assets:

1.  **`UI_STYLE_GUIDE.md`**: A markdown document in the root directory that serves as the official specification for the design system.
2.  **`lib/material_constants.py`**: A Python file containing all the color and font constants for the theme.
3.  **`style_material.py`**: A new theme file that uses the constants to apply Material Design styles to all `ttk` widgets.
4.  **`lib/ui_helpers.py`**: A set of helper functions (e.g., `StyledButton`, `StyledLabel`) that abstract the creation of styled widgets, making it easy to apply the design system consistently.

The application was updated to use this new theme by default in `App.py`.

### Rationale
Adopting a formal design system provides several key benefits:
-   **Consistency:** Ensures that all UI elements across the application have a consistent look and feel.
-   **Clarity:** Provides a clear set of rules for both human and AI developers to follow, reducing ambiguity.
-   **Efficiency:** The use of `ui_helpers.py` speeds up development by providing ready-to-use, pre-styled components.
-   **Maintainability:** Centralizing style definitions in `style_material.py` and `lib/material_constants.py` makes the theme easier to manage and update in the future.
-   **Professionalism:** A consistent, well-designed UI provides a more professional and intuitive user experience.
